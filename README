These assets will make more sense if you're following my posts. 

You can find the posts at my blog:

Be aware that the posts on my blog were written when Rails 2.0 was just released...we're at 2.3 now! There are going to be differences that I will need to address later.

These applications were created for Rails 2.3. What version are you running?

ng$ rails -v
Rails 2.3.0
